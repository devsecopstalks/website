It’s been a while since OpenTofu was released to the public, so we wanted to check in on where it stands today. How is the community adopting it? What’s the public sentiment? And how does it differ from Terraform in terms of features?

This time we’re joined by Cole Bittel, an experienced SRE, platform engineer, and contributor to OpenTofu. He shares his hands-on experience migrating to OpenTofu, and we look into the problems teams face with infrastructure as code and how both Terraform and OpenTofu approach solving them.
