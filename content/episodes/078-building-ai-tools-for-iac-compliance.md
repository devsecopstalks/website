In this guest episode, we chat with Davlet Dzhakishev, co-founder of Cloudgeni, who’s working on an AI-powered approach to fixing compliance issues in IaC. What’s the state of tools in this space? Where does his idea fit in? And how should we think about the relationship between compliance and security?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Connect with us on LinkedIn or Twitter (see info at https://devsecops.fm/about/).
